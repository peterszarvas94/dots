# Steps I done

1. bootsrapped with omarchy (needed to enable wifi device though)
2. installed tmux, zsh, nvm (node), go, extra/ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd
3. removed default alacritty, nvim config
4. moved hyprland and waybar logic to stow
5. run stow

# TODO

- git keys
- lower grub time
- autostart hyprland -> later
- keybinds
- steal theme logic from omarchy, but with base16/24
- fix keyboard issue with `~
- clean up bloat
